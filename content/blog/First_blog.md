<a class="font-bold">> Here Is Why <</a>
<br>
<a>As a computer engineer, you need to learn alot on daily bases. And one of the important skills of them all is web development.</a>
<br>
<a>Hold on, you don't need to be this amazing web developer who knows every possible javascript framework available. Nor you need to be a Computer Engineer. Seriously, Everyone should have a website. Whether you are a gardner, shopkepper, sales person, or just a traveller who is wandering around the world. Having website will always add up an extra point to whatever your profession is.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a class="font-bold">> But Where To Get Started <</a>
<br>
<a>If you are a total beginner, go to youtube right now and type.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a class="border-stone-600 border-2 pr-3 pl-3 p-1 rounded">make simple page using HTML</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=make+simple+page+using+html" target="_blank" class="font-bold border-stone-600 border-2 p-1 rounded hover:text-white hover:bg-black hover:border-black">Search</a>
<br>
<br>
<a>After having a good idea on how things work, make plain, simple html pages. Don't bother about styling your website. Keep in mind im telling you to make a html page not a website.</a>

<a>For starters add little bit of your information. Your name, email address, what is your profession and so on. Your website allows you to provide a platform to present yourself in a very sophisticated and professional manner. If you are a painter, you can have images of your works on your website. If you are a house painter, you can take images of your works and show people how well you have done the job. There are seriously no limitation to what you can do with a website.</a>
<br>
<a>But what could limit your website is how much effort you put into it. Your website should show your personality, work and intrests you poses. You could pay a person to make a website for you but then it won't be yours. <br> Now as you have created several HTML pages, its time to add some bling to your website.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a class="font-bold">> Adding Bling To Your Ugly Website <</a>
<br>
<a>Your time is over with your ugly website that you don't even wanna see yourself. Now for styling your website, if you are still not aware about this, we use something called CSS [Cascading Style Sheet]. You can writer your css in two formates.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a class="mono-font font-bold">1. In a seprate style.css file <br>2. In an html file between the < style > tag.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a class="font-bold">> 1 Formate <</a>
<br>
<a>Create a file name style.css in the same directory where index.html is located. Now open your index.html and add this line in between the < head > tags.</a>
<br>
