<a class="font-bold">> Here Is Why <</a>
<br>
<a>As a computer engineer, you need to learn alot on daily bases. And one of the important skills of them all is web development.</a>
<br>
<a>Hold on, you don't need to be this amazing web developer who knows every possible javascript framework available. Nor you need to be a Computer Engineer. Seriously, Everyone should have a website. Whether you are a gardner, shopkepper, sales person, or just a traveller who is wandering around the world. Having website will always add up an extra point to whatever your profession is.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a class="font-bold">> But Where To Get Started <</a>
<br>
<a>If you are a total beginner, go to youtube right now and type.</a>

<br>
<br>
<a>After having a good idea on how things work, make plain, simple html pages. Don't bother about styling your website. Keep in mind im telling you to make a html page not a website.</a>

<a>For starters add little bit of your information. Your name, email address, what is your profession and so on. Your website allows you to provide a platform to present yourself in a very sophisticated and professional manner. If you are a painter, you can have images of your works on your website. If you are a house painter, you can take images of your works and show people how well you have done the job. There are seriously no limitation to what you can do with a website.</a>
